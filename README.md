# Toggle Dark Mode

An animated toggle for dark mode.  This was a personal challenge that I finished while completing Scrimba's Learn React course. You can see this project deployed [here](https://witty-wave-095869c1e.2.azurestaticapps.net/).

## Design

The design was taken from [this GIF](https://dribbble.com/shots/5846239-Light-dark-toggle-switch-InVision-Studio) on Matthieu Souteyrand's dribble account.
